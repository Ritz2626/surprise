      A very happy birthday dear❤❤.. May your day be filled with magical and unforgettable  moments✨🌈.. The moments spend with you are always full of fun and laughter...Though we are not able to talk so frequently now as we used to do but u will always have that special place in my heart 💖💖.. I still remember the first time one we met in some coaching class we didn't even knew that we were in the same class...when I look back I always remember the nonesense talks that we used to do sitting at the last bench of the class, those pitty fights over whatsApp replies especially 😂😂, those attending coaching classes together, the night stay, our morning walks, those yoga sessions, those watching movies together, I still remember how difficult it was to convince aunty😂😅...These are some of the beautiful memories that are gone remain with me forever and there are lots of memories to be still made!! 💞💞.. Once again a very happy birthday baby doll❤❤ (I know u love this name 😜😂😂).
